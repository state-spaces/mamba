# Mamba adoption

We've been very happy to see Mamba being adopted by many organizations
and research labs to speed up their training / inference.
This page contains a partial list of places where Mamba is being used.
If you'd like to add links to your organization / product / codebase, please open a
PR or email us. We'd very much like to hear from you!
